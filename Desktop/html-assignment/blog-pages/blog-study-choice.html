        The main reason why I have chosen the programme is professional practice. As far as I am concerned this type of
        knowledge is crucial to being competitive in the IT job market. Technical skills that you teach in your classes
        will result in a higher chance of me getting my dream job.<br><p> </p>
        My dream job is to be a mobile application designer as well as a network security engineer. The first one gives
        me the possibility to develop my creativity in creating applications that provide people with entertainment or
        increase the level of life satisfaction on day to day basis. The second one opens possibilities for me to help
        people with their safety on the internet. Data leaks or other incidents are a huge threat to society as a whole,
        so I believe that solving these problems could be really beneficial to everyone.<br><p> </p>
        I'm realy keen on IT, it's my favourite subject at highschool and I belive it won't change at university
