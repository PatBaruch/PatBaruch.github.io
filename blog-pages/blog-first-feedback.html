        Your motivation is nice but still a bit too general, why are you interested in IT? What you consider your dream
        job? Why? Why is this knowledge crucial? What is the knowledge youre seeking? What makes you interested in this
        study program in particular? I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career and to
        search for the true motivation that will keep you going throughout the study program. This will be very helpful
        in difficult situations or challenges that you may encounter during your education.<br>

        When looking at your future goals after completing the studies, its very nice to see you put a thought into
        future career options you would like to work at. I recommend to research more about those positions, what a day
        to day looks like? Where would you like to work? Any particular areas? Deepen the knowledge, what will be
        required from you, will you work with teams or alone? I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference
        upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information about different professions in the ICT
        field.<br>

        Referring to your SWOT analysis, it shows you are aware of your strengths and weaknesses, which is very
        important as a future professional. Being friendly and creative are very good qualities to have during your
        studies and professional career. To deepen your understanding of yourself and help you find tools to endure the
        studies, I recommend asking yourself questions like, how will you handle situations where others do not want to
        follow your way or suggest other solutions? How can you practice and help yourself to not miss important
        details?<br>

        This feedback opened my eyes on parts that i need some more work.
